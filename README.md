# goshell
Really simple unix shell written in go (it really doesn't do anything but running programs)

Download:
```
git clone https://github.com/some0necoding/goshell.git

cd goshell/main

go build -o goshell shell.go

sudo mv goshell /usr/local/bin
```
I suggest to not use it as it cannot yet interpret quoted text as a single string

Edit: now it can

Edit: maybe, it's not really tested ;)
